## 📘 Decoding Emotion Through Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Conversation

### 🔍 Problem Statement

In today’s digital world, social media platforms have become a powerful medium for users to express thoughts, emotions, and opinions. These vast amounts of unstructured text data hold valuable emotional insights, but interpreting them manually is impractical. This project aims to build a machine learning model capable of decoding emotions such as **joy, anger, sadness, surprise, fear**, etc., from user-generated content across social platforms.

### 🎯 Project Objectives

* Build a **multi-class classification** model for emotion detection in social media text.
* Preprocess and clean noisy, unstructured social media data.
* Perform **EDA** to uncover patterns and emotional trends.
* Use **TF-IDF**, **Bag-of-Words**, and **embeddings** for feature extraction.
* Implement and compare models: **Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, SVM**.
* Evaluate using metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**.
* Deploy the model with **Streamlit** to predict emotions from user-input text.

### 🗂 Dataset

* 📁 Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kashishparmar02/social-media-sentiments-analysis-dataset)
* 🧾 Format: CSV
* 📊 Records: 732
* 📌 Features: `Text`, `Sentiment`, `User`, `Platform`, `Timestamp`, `Likes`, `Retweets`, `Country`, etc.
* 🎯 Labels: Positive, Neutral, Negative

### 🔄 Workflow

```
Data Collection → Preprocessing → EDA → Feature Engineering → Model Building → Evaluation → Deployment
```

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

* **Sentiment distribution** showed a moderate class imbalance (Neutral > Positive > Negative).
* **Frequent words**: Words like *love*, *worst*, *okay* strongly correlate with emotional tones.
* **Word clouds**, **count plots**, and **length distributions** helped understand vocabulary patterns.

### 🛠 Feature Engineering

* **Text vectorization**: TF-IDF with unigrams and bigrams.
* **Categorical encoding**: One-hot for platform, label encoding for sentiment.
* **Metadata**: Included features like likes, retweets, hashtags, post length, and emojis.

### 🤖 Model Building

| Model               | Accuracy | Notes                                            |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Logistic Regression | \~85%    | Fast baseline with good performance              |
| Naive Bayes         | \~82%    | Light model but lower on minority classes        |
| XGBoost             | \~89%    | Best performer with highest precision and recall |
| SVM                 | \~87%    | Balanced, robust with sparse TF-IDF vectors      |

**Selected Model**: XGBoost for deployment due to superior accuracy and handling of imbalance.
